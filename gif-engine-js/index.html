On this page you will be able to observe how one could utilize gif-engine-js efficiently to display GIF images on a canvas by looking at the source of the page and the script setting things up (main.js).<br />
Please do note that this example here uses Workers to avoid any and all JANK in the UI thread for a pleasant experience. The additional code that was inserted into gif-engine-js.js after the main function declaration can be found <a href="//gist.github.com/friendlyanon/c63fe71a01001ce744b94cb65a8fca1e" target="_blank">in this Gist</a>.<br />
I decided to not include it in the project, because it would make the engine not so bare-bones anymore and if the user wishes to implement a worker addition on their own, then they are more than welcome to transform the engine's code for their own needs or just copy paste my own implementation.
